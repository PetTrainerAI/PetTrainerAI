# PetTrainerAI: AI-Powered Dog Training System

Welcome to **PetTrainerBot**, a cutting-edge project combining AI and robotics to revolutionize pet training. This repository provides the foundational code for a simulated robotic system capable of training dogs by recognizing their behaviors and offering reinforcement, all powered by AI.

---

## Project Overview

### Key Features
- **AI-Powered Pet Training**:
  - A simulated robotic trainer that recognizes pet behaviors (e.g., sitting, barking) and rewards desired actions.
  - Reinforcement learning-based system tailored to individual pet behaviors.

- **Behavior Customization**:
  - Adaptable training routines based on the dog's personality and progress.

- **Gamification Potential**:
  - Progress tracking for training milestones.
  - Opportunities for showcasing trained pets in future interactive systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Programming Languages**:
  - Python 3.9+
- **Tools**:
  - Node.js and npm (for frontend development)
  - Flask/FastAPI (for backend API)

---

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/PetTrainerBot.git
cd PetTrainerBot
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

- **AI Simulation**:
```bash
cd ai_simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

### Usage

#### 1. Run the AI Simulation
```bash
python ai_simulation/train_pet.py
```
This simulates pet behavior detection and training using reinforcement learning.

#### 2. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
The API server handles interactions between the AI simulation and frontend.

#### 3. Launch the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Components

### 1. AI Simulation
#### `train_pet.py`
This Python script simulates a robotic trainer using reinforcement learning. Example outputs include:
- Detected pet behaviors.
- Reward dispensing logic.

#### Key Functions
- `detect_behavior`: Simulates behavior detection.
- `train_pet`: Implements reward logic.

---

### 2. Frontend
A React-based dashboard for:
- Monitoring pet training progress.
- Adjusting training routines.
- Viewing training metrics.

---

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Proof-of-Concept (current repository).
2. **Phase 2**: Develop a hardware prototype of the robotic trainer.
3. **Phase 3**: Expand training options and interactivity.
